            <p>Harry Potter is a boy whose parents, wizards, were murdered by a powerful wizard when he was 
            still a baby. He was then taken to the home of his uncles who had nothing to do with the supernatural.
            Quite the opposite. Until he was 10 years old, Harry was a kind of Cinderella: mistreated by his uncles, 
            he inherited old clothes from his chubby cousin, had patched glasses and was treated as a nuisance.
            On the day of his 11th birthday, however, he seemed to slip down a bottomless pit, like Alice in Wonderland,
            which led him to a magical world.</p>
            <p> <b> Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, 1999 </b> </p>
            <div class="img"> <img src="PRI.jpg" height="180" width="150"> </div>
            <p>It's the beginning of their third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry, 
            Ron and Hermione have a lot to learn. But a threat is lurking around the school, and it's called
            Sirius Black. After twelve years incarcerated in Azkaban prison, he manages to escape and returns 
            to avenge his master, Lord Voldemort.</p>

            <div class="img"> <img src="ORD.jpg" height="180" width="150"> </div>
            <p>After a disastrous summer, Harry returns for his fifth year at Hogwarts, one of the most
            difficult he will ever face. Very few students and parents believe him or Dumbledore about
            Voldemort's return, and an endless series of articles circulate saying that they are completely crazy.</p>
            <p> <b> Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, 2005 </b> </p>
            <div class="img"> <img src="ENI.jpg" height="180" width="150"> </div>
            <p>In Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters are wreaking
            havoc in both the wizarding and Muggle worlds. Dumbledore convinces his old friend Horace 
            Slughorn to return to Hogwarts as Potions teacher after Harry finds a strange schoolbook.</p>

            <p> The Marauder's Map is a Hogwarts map with magical properties 
            created in the 1970s, before the birth of Harry and his friends, by the four Marauders: Remus Lupin (Moony), 
            Peter Pettigrew (Wormtail), Sirius Black (Padfoot) and James Potter (Prongs). Activated only by saying the phrase 
            I solemnly swear I am up to no good and deactivated by the phrase mischief done, the map is capable of showing the exact location 
            of each person within the boundaries of Hogwarts (their movements are indicated by footprints), as well as indicating paths,
            secret passages and other points of interest throughout the castle and its grounds.</p>

            <p>T.S. Riddle's Diary was a blank diary that Tom Riddle transformed into a Horcrux. 
            This event occurred in 1943, during Riddle's sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft 
            and Wizardry, and was the first Horcrux he made. Before Lord Voldemort's first defeat in 1981, 
            the diary was passed to Death Eater Lucius Malfoy, who kept it secret before storing it in Ginny Weasley's
            cauldron of school supplies in Flourish and Blotts in 1992. The diary used its magical influence to possess 
            Ginny and force her to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.
            The diary, however, was destroyed by Harry Potter in 1993 with a basilisk fang.</p>
